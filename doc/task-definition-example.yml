# Required, string with format version of this file
format_version: "1.1"

# Required, either a string or a list of strings with file-name patterns.
# Relative paths interpreted as relative to this file.
# Each matching file or directory will be given as input to the tool.
input_files:
  - '*.md'
  - '../*.md'

# Optional, either a string or a list of strings with file-name patterns.
# Relative paths interpreted as relative to this file.
# Each matching file or directory is treated as required for the task,
# but will not be explicitly given to the tool.
required_files:
  - './'

# Optional, contains list of dicts, each with at least the key "property_file".
# Existing entries specify which properties can be used for tasks from this file.
# If given, benchexec will compare expected verdicts against actual verdicts.
properties:
  - property_file: ../test/tasks/test.prp        # string with file-name pattern that matches exactly one file
    expected_verdict: false                      # optional boolean
    subproperty: valid-deref                     # optional string, contains violated subproperty
  - property_file: ../test/tasks/other.prp
    expected_verdict: true

# Optional, contains dict that provides additional information
# that is not interpreted by benchexec.
# If given, benchexec will pass this information to the tool-info module.
#
# Each key in the dict defines a namespace for additional information.
# Each namespace contains another dict with key-value pairs in that namespace.
# These key-value pairs describe the concrete, additional information.
#
# Namespaces, additional information and their values are not interpreted by benchexec
# and may differ between application areas.

  # Example namespace
  com.github.sosy-lab.sv-benchmarks:
      # Example information in the above namespace:
      # Machine model the task definition is defined for.
      # Properties of this task definition are only guaranteed to be
      # valid on the input_files for the machine model specified here.
      #
      # Values tools are expected to support: x86_32-unknown-linux, x86_64-unknown-linux
      target_architecture: x86_32-unknown-linux

# All other keys in the global dict and in the properties dict are reserved for future use.
